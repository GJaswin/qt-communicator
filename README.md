# QT Communicator - A Simple Chatting Application

QT Communicator is a simple, user-friendly chatting application built with **Qt Quick (QML)** and **C++** for the frontend and integrated with **Firebase** for the backend using **JavaScript**. This project provides essential features like user authentication (login/signup) and real-time chatting.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure login and signup functionality using Firebase Authentication.
- **Real-Time Chatting**: Seamless messaging experience powered by Firebase Realtime Database.
- **Responsive Design**: Designed with Qt Quick (QML) for a smooth and responsive UI.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Qt Quick (QML) and C++
- **Backend**: Firebase (Authentication & Realtime Database)
- **Scripting**: JavaScript for Firebase integration

---

## Prerequisites

- Qt Creator installed with support for Qt Quick and C++
- Firebase project set up (Firebase Authentication and Realtime Database enabled)
- Node.js installed (for Firebase configuration)

## Third-Party Libraries Used

This project uses a few third-party libraries to enhance functionality where equivalent features were not natively available in Qt. Below is a list of libraries and justifications for their inclusion:

### 1. **Firebase SDK (JavaScript)**
   - **Reason**: Qt does not provide direct support for Firebase Authentication or Realtime Database. The Firebase SDK offers robust and easy-to-integrate APIs for authentication, database interaction, and real-time updates.
   - **Benefit**: Using the Firebase SDK simplifies backend management, allowing us to focus on frontend features.
